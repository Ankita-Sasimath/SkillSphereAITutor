## 📊 Example Improvements

### User asks: "What should I learn next?"

**Before:**
"Based on your skill levels, I'd recommend checking out the Courses page."

**After:**
"I see you've completed 'Machine Learning Fundamentals' and you're currently 45% through 'Data Science Basics' on Coursera. Great progress! 

Since you've assessed your Machine Learning skills as Intermediate, I'd recommend continuing with 'Data Science Basics' to finish it, then exploring more advanced Machine Learning courses. Based on your learning pattern, you seem to prefer hands-on courses, so I'd suggest checking out practical projects next.

Would you like me to suggest specific advanced courses, or would you prefer to focus on completing your current course first?"

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **User sends message** → AI analyzes:
   - Current question

   - Recent topics discussed

2. **AI generates response** using:
   - Enhanced system prompt with full context
   - Adaptive learning insights
   - Personalized data references
   - ChatGPT-like conversation style

3. **Response is**:
   - Unique and contextual
